\title{Inferential Median Calculator for Ordinal Data}
\usage{
iom(input, conflvl)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{A vector of ordinal data. Type: integer.}

\item{conflvl}{(optional) The desired confidence level. Default is 0.95. Type: non-negative real.}
}
\value{
The inferential median. Type: integer.
}
\description{
Inferentially determines the median of ordinal (e.g. Likert) data. The input data is outrightly assumed to be ordinal in nature and not normally distributed. Performs a series of one-sample Wilcoxon Rank tests to inferentially ascertain where the ordinal data tends to gravitate. iom stands for "inferential ordinal median".
